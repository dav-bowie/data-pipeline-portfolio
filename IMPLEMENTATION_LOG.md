## 3. Files Created & Their Purpose

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Portfolio landing page. Links to roadmap, projects (GitHub), and live dashboards. |
| `roadmap.html` | Full data pipeline mastery roadmap. Tabs: Roadmap, Tech Stack, Projects, Repo + Website, N8N Pipelines, Skills Plan, Soccer. Contains `PORTFOLIO` config object for live links. |
| `dashboards/app.py` | Streamlit app. Uses `Path(__file__)` for data path so it works locally and on Streamlit Cloud. Plots `data/revenue.csv` as MoM line chart. |
| `data/revenue.csv` | Sample CSV: `month`, `revenue` columns. 12 months of synthetic data. |
| `requirements.txt` | `streamlit`, `pandas`, `plotly`, `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2-binary` |
| `.gitignore` | `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `.env.local`, `.DS_Store` |
| `projects/*/README.md` | Template per project: Objective, Architecture, Key Findings, Tech Stack, Live Demo, How to Run |

---

## 4. Live URLs (as of Implementation)

| Resource | URL | Status |
|----------|-----|--------|
| GitHub Repo | https://github.com/dav-bowie/data-pipeline-portfolio | Live |
| Portfolio (GitHub Pages) | https://dav-bowie.github.io/data-pipeline-portfolio/ | Live |
| Roadmap (GitHub Pages) | https://dav-bowie.github.io/data-pipeline-portfolio/roadmap.html | Live |
| Streamlit Dashboard | https://dav-bowie.streamlit.app | Pending deploy |

---

## 5. What Was Implemented (Chronological)

### Phase 1 — Repo & Structure
- Created folder structure per roadmap instructions
- Set up `projects/`, `dashboards/`, `pipelines/`, `notebooks/`, `sql/`, `data/`
- Added project README templates with Objective, Architecture, Key Findings, Tech Stack, Live Demo, How to Run

### Phase 2 — Streamlit App
- Created `dashboards/app.py` with Plotly line chart
- Added `data/revenue.csv` (sample MoM revenue)
- Used `Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data" / "revenue.csv"` for cross-platform and Streamlit Cloud compatibility

### Phase 3 — GitHub Integration
- Cloned repo `https://github.com/dav-bowie/data-pipeline-portfolio.git` into `data-pipeline-portfolio-repo`
- Copied full structure into cloned repo
- Updated all placeholders (`yourname`, `yourusername`) to `dav-bowie`

### Phase 4 — Portfolio Website
- Created `index.html` with project links (GitHub repo tree URLs)
- Added "Learning Roadmap" button → `roadmap.html`
- Project cards link to GitHub project folders

### Phase 5 — Roadmap (Active Links)
- Added `roadmap.html` from `data-analytics-roadmap.html`
- Introduced `PORTFOLIO` config object at top of script for centralized URLs
- Project cards 01–05 link to GitHub project folders via config
- Hero: Live Portfolio, Live Dashboard buttons
- Footer: My Repo, Live Dashboard, Portfolio Site links
- Copied `roadmap.html` into portfolio repo

### Phase 6 — GitHub Pages
- GitHub Pages enabled: Source = main branch, Path = / (root)
- Portfolio and roadmap confirmed live

---

## 6. Configuration Reference

### Roadmap `PORTFOLIO` Object (in `roadmap.html`)

```javascript
const PORTFOLIO = {
  repo: 'https://github.com/dav-bowie/data-pipeline-portfolio',
  portfolio: 'https://dav-bowie.github.io/data-pipeline-portfolio',
  streamlit: 'https://dav-bowie.streamlit.app',
  projects: {
    saas: '.../projects/saas-revenue',
    ecommerce: '.../projects/ecommerce',
    dataQuality: '.../projects/data-quality',
    soccer: '.../projects/soccer-analytics',
    liveDashboard: '.../projects/live-dashboard',
    dashboards: '.../dashboards',
    pipelines: '.../pipelines',
    notebooks: '.../notebooks'
  }
};
```

Update this object when adding new projects or changing URLs.

## 7. Pending / Not Yet Done

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Streamlit Cloud deploy | Deploy `dashboards/app.py` at share.streamlit.io; main file path: `dashboards/app.py` |
| Supabase setup | Optional. Connection string in `.env`; add `.env` to `.gitignore` (already done) |
| Project content | Fill in each `projects/*/README.md` with real objectives, architecture, findings |
| N8N pipelines | Add workflow JSON exports to `pipelines/` |
| Notebooks | Add Jupyter EDA notebooks to `notebooks/` |
| SQL scripts | Add SQL scripts/schemas to `sql/` |

---

## 8. Local Commands Reference

```bash
# Navigate to repo
cd /Users/db/Desktop/DataAnalyst/data-pipeline-portfolio-repo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit locally
streamlit run dashboards/app.py

# Git push (after changes)
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

---

## 9. Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Project links go to GitHub | GitHub Pages doesn’t render subfolder READMEs; GitHub tree URLs work reliably |
| `Path(__file__)` for data path | Ensures app works locally and on Streamlit Cloud |
| Centralized `PORTFOLIO` config in roadmap | One place to update all live links |
| Two local folders | `data-pipeline-portfolio` = original; `data-pipeline-portfolio-repo` = git-tracked clone |
